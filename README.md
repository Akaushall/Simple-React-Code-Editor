Simple Code Editor with Syntax Highlighting using React and PrismJS:

This project demonstrates how to build a simple code editor in React with syntax highlighting capabilities using PrismJS.

Overview
A code editor is implemented using a textarea element for input and PrismJS for syntax highlighting. This allows users to write and view code with color-coded syntax directly in the editor.

Technologies Used:

React.js
PrismJS (for syntax highlighting)
Features
Syntax highlighting for various programming languages supported by PrismJS.
Basic text editing functionalities (e.g., typing, editing, deleting).

Installation:
To run this project locally:
Clone the repository from GitHub:

git clone <repository-url>
cd simple-code-editor

Install dependencies:
npm install

Start the development server:
npm start
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the application.

Usage:
Type or paste your code into the textarea.
The code will be automatically syntax-highlighted using PrismJS.
Edit the code to see real-time syntax highlighting updates.

Code Editor Component:
The main component responsible for the code editor functionality is CodeEditor.js, which includes the textarea for input and PrismJS integration for syntax highlighting.

Conclusion:
This project serves as a foundational example of how to implement a code editor with syntax highlighting using React and PrismJS. Feel free to customize and expand upon it based on your requirements.
